  ## Description
A workout tracker with a Mongo database, a Mongoose schema, and Express routes. There are 2 different types of exercise to choose from with seperate promts to fill in for each. If it is not your first time visiting, the previous workout information is displayed. Once a form for a new workout is filled in, there's an option to continue adding to your workout session or complete the workout. Navigating to your dashboard gives you a visualization of the time you spent working out and the resistance amount chosen for each workout session.
